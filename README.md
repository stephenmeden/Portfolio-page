# Portfolio-page
Created a front-end interactive page with my background information - The front-end code only

WEB-PAGE DEMONSTRATION/PROTOTYPE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I assume you were directed to my github through the link on my resume. This readme file will direct you to all the functionalities of the webpage.

1) On page load
2) Click the "Open login" button on the header tab - the profile icon on the far right of the header tab
3) Fill out both username, password fields, and check the box (Note: It doesn't have to be an authorized user login, you can type anything into both fields)
4) Click the "Submit" button 
5) An arrow down button will appear which is clickable
6) Notice the input from earlier is saved - Click the "Submit" button once more and now all links on the header tabs are unlocked
7) All the pages can now be accessed. 

Thank you for taking the time for checking out my portfolio! 

I also created a full front-end and server side webpage, click the link to view more.
