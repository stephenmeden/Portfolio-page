# Portfolio-page
Created a front-end interactive page with my background - The front-end code only
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WEB-PAGE DEMONSTRATION/prototype
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) The page loads 
2) Click the "Open login" button on the header tab - the profile icon on the far right of the header tab
3) Fill out both username, password fields, and check the box (Note: It doesn't have to be an authorized user login, you can type anything into both fields)
4) Click the "Submit" button 
5) An arrow down button will appear which is clickable
6) Notice the input from earlier is saved - Click the "Submit" button once more and now all links on the header tabs are unlocked
7) All the pages can now be accessed. 

Thank you for taking the time to checking out my portfolio!
